Hi 👋, I am a third (final) year Ph.D. Candidate, advised by [Prof. Byunghoon Kim](https://sites.google.com/hanyang.ac.kr/bigdataanalyticslab/people?authuser=0) in the [Big Data Analytics Lab](https://sites.google.com/hanyang.ac.kr/bigdataanalyticslab/home), Dept. of Industrial & Management Engineering at Hanyang University, South Korea.

My research interests broadly lie in **Computer Vision (CV)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Machine Learning (ML)** algorithms. Currently, I am focused in researching on computer vision problems like object detection, recognition, segmentation. Additoinally, I have a keen interest in **Multimodal AI**, exploring the integration of vision and language, with particular interests in image captioning and visual question answering.

Previously, I have been researching and working on **Network Science**, **Graph Mining**, **Data Mining**, and **Applied Machine Learning**, specifically focusing on modeling large inter-connected complex networks, including financial transactions and social networks.

Apart from research, I like 📷 photography, 🏔️ hiking and ✈️ travelling to new places and thankfully they go together 😅. Thank you for your time reading this far. Wish you have a nice day ahead ❤️.
