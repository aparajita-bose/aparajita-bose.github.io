Hi 👋, I am a third (final) year Ph.D. Candidate, advised by [Prof. Byunghoon Kim](https://sites.google.com/hanyang.ac.kr/bigdataanalyticslab/people?authuser=0) in the [Big Data Analytics Lab](https://sites.google.com/hanyang.ac.kr/bigdataanalyticslab/home), Dept. of Industrial & Management Engineering at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/home), South Korea.

My research interests broadly lie in **Computer Vision (CV)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Machine Learning (ML)** algorithms. These days, I am researching on computer vision problems like object detection, recognition, segmentation. I am also interested in **Multimodal AI**, that explores the integration of vision and language for tasks like image captioning and visual question answering.

In the past, my research has been on **Network Science**, **Graph Mining**, **Data Mining**, and **Applied Machine Learning** problems. My focus was on modeling large inter-connected complex networks, such as financial transaction networks and social networks.

Apart from research, I like 📷 photography, 🏔️ hiking and ✈️ traveling to new places and thankfully they go together 😅. Thank you for your time reading this far. Hope you have a nice day ahead ❤️.
