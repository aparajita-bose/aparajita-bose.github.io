  abstract       = {Technology valuation methods are classified into income-based, cost-based, and market-based approaches depending on the perspective of valuing technology. The market approach evaluates the value of technology by referring to cases in which similar technologies have been traded before. In this study, we use prior technology transaction data to estimate the technology value based on the market approach and to identify influential factors to the estimated value. To this end, we adopt a multivariate k-nearest neighbor (MKNN) regression model to accommodate mixed-type input variables aiming at estimating multivariate technology values, selecting influencing factors, and the relative importance of the selected factors. In addition, we can optimize the number of transaction cases k in k-NN regression. Our proposed regression model outperforms an embedding model with cosine similarity in predicting multivariate response variables. In addition, we illustrate how to select and assess the influential factors based on the real-life dataset.},

  abstract  = {Complex networks offer a powerful framework for modeling real-world phenomena by capturing the intricate interplay between components across various domains. Financial transaction networks are vital representations of inter-firm relationships, where firms and transactions serve as nodes and edges, respectively. Link prediction within such networks is an important problem, which targets to find the likelihood of a future transaction between firms, and to facilitate informed decision-making processes and market insights. It also can be used to predict missing transaction or link between firms to obtain comprehensive knowledge as missing transactional information is difficult to access between firms. Multiple link prediction studies have been proposed for networks, but there are a few studies have been proposed for financial transaction network. However, the existing studies often overlook the unique features of financial transaction networks, thereby hindering accurate link prediction procedure. In this study, we propose a novel similarity score, the "AttrTran Sim Score" for financial transaction network, which integrates both structural information transactions network and attribute of firms, particularly industrial classification code (SIC code), to predict unobserved links between firms. Our proposed method for link prediction not only predicts new transactions between firms but also preserves the hierarchical nature of transaction networks. By leveraging both - the network structural information, and the firm's attribute frequencies, the proposed similarity score for link prediction became more robust based on our experimental results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) on real-world transaction network datasets, that outperformed existing similarity-based link prediction methods.

  abstract  = {Market segmentation is a challenging and necessary task for improving marketing strategies and allocating resources effectively in a complex scenario of industrial or business-to-business (B2B) markets. Most of the traditional methods have not provided comprehensive and detailed guidelines to process massive, complex, and complicated data from financial transactions in industrial market. Furthermore, they often overlook the overlapping nature of segments, where a firm might belong to multiple segments of market. Financial transaction networks (FTNs) can be depicted as graph, where nodes and edges represent firms and transactions, respectively. A few network analysis studies have been employed for industrial market analysis, but those efforts are missed to capture the important features of financial transactions, such as the number of transactions, transaction volume, direction of transactions, and firm-specific attributes. In this study, we propose a novel method for industrial market segmentation that utilizes both financial multiple transactions and attribute of firms. By integrating a graph-based generative probabilistic model, we reveal and understand the complex and overlapping relationships within financial transaction data. Subsequently, we apply the proposed method to a real-world dataset. The results show that the proposed method outperforms established methods in network analysis, such as clustering and community detection in transactional industrial market (B2B) network.},
